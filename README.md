# Diabetic_prediction
This project predicts an individual's risk of diabetes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model integrated into a user-friendly web application. Users enter health information such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, age, number of pregnancies, and other key metrics through a simple graphical interface.
